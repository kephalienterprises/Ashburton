<h1>About Us</h1>

<div class="light">
        We are a group of Christians meeting and serving the Lord together as a local church belonging to Christ (Rom. 16:16; Acts 9:31; Matt. 16:18). We humbly strive to carry out God’s eternal plan for His church where we live (1 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 3:10; 1 Pet. 2:4-5). We have only the scriptures to guide our faith and work. (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 1 Peter 4:11; Acts 20:32; Rom. 10:17) We are determined to worship and work together according to the instructions found in the word of Christ. (Matt. 28:18-20; John 4:23-24; 1 Cor. 14:37) We do not employ in our worship or our work methods or means which God has not commanded us to use. (1 Cor. 3:11; 1 Tim. 1:3; 2 Cor. 4:6-7; II John 1:9) It is our great privilege to be called into the body of Christ and have a place of service with His saints. (Eph. 1:22-23; 2:16-22; 4:11-16; 1 Pet. 2:9-10)
        <br />
        <br />
        We invite any and all to join us in the worship of our great God and obedient service to the glorious calling of the gospel of Jesus Christ. (2 Thess. 2:14-15)

                Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.

                He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.

                And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell, and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross.

                And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight— if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister.

        <br />
        In our worship we do our best to honor God as He has demonstrated we should in the New Testament. (John 4:24; Heb. 8:4-6; )

        A typical Sunday morning begins with prayer and Bible study at 9 am. In the next hour, we pray, sing (acapella), read the scriptures, preach, observe the Lord’s Supper, and take up a voluntary collection from the members of the church. (1 Timothy 2:8; Eph. 5:19; 1 Timothy 4:13; 1 Cor. 11:23-28; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:1-2)
